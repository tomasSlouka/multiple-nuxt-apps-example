                <p class='strong'>Hi there! My name is Tomas, and I'm the founder of ManyLetter.
                I would like introduce you to ManyLetter and why I have created it.</p>

                <h3>Why I create ManyLetter?</h3>
                <p class='mb10'>
                    One of the biggest problems we face today is too much information. We are continually inundated with news, messages, emails, notifications. We are bombarded with information all the time, from every angle, and at every turn. In one sense, we are in the most incredible time in human history for learning. But on the other side, we are so distracted. Sometimes that much that we end up paralyzed and can not even move.
                </p>
                <p class='mb10'>
                    I'm subscribed to too many newsletters and it has become annoying. So I started to browse the internet and search for some tool that makes my email inbox less inundated by messages. I have found some tools but almost all of them was unusable or hard to use. I really didn't want my inbox under control of a third party or use browser extensions. I wanted something easy to use, something, that will give me control over all newsletters and make my inbox distraction-free.
                </p>
                <p class='mb10'>
                    So I have come up with the idea of ManyLetter.
                </p>
                <p class='mb10'>    
                    ManyLetter is created to address these problems. Its primary focus is to reduce the number of email messages that users are receiving every day, by combining many newsletters into one (that is where the name of ManyLetter comes from). ManyLetter has built-in features that provide users with options that save time, make the inbox tidy, reduce the number of notifications received as well as help creators to create newsletters that their subscribers will love.

                <h3>Why should you join ManyLetter?</h3>
                <p class='mb10'>
                   I'm thrilled about ManyLetter's future as we would like to create a friendly platform that will allow everyone to find and join any newsletter, as well as to create a newsletter and share it with other people.
                </p>
                <!-- <p class='mb10'>
                   What is also very important to say, is that, that ManyLetter can protect your privacy because when subscribing to newsletters your email address stays anonymous but you will still receive the messages. Isn't that great?
                </p> -->
                <p class='mb40'>Hope to see you in ManyLetter.</p>

            <h2>The problems we are trying to solve</h2>
            <p class=''>Users oftentimes struggle to manage their newsletter subscriptions. Many times they don't even have the option to do so. After some time they realize, that their inbox is full of unread messages from various sources. They don't even recognize many of them. They are getting hundreds of notifications about incoming messages on their desktops and mobile devices and over time it is becoming very annoying.</p>
            <h4>Subscribers problems list</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>too many emails</li>
                <li>too many notifications</li>
                <li>too much distraction</li>
                <li>hard to manage inbox</li>
                <li>unable to manage subscriptions at one place</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On the other hand, there are creators who want to bring quality content to their subscribers. Creators have their own challenges that they need to overcome. For example, flat user base, low open rates, lack of quality content, etc. Nowadays, users are so cautious about to whom they give their email address. Therefore email marketing is harder. Tools like MailChimp are great but they have one thing in common. They don't think about the subscribers and literally spamming emails everywhere.</p>
            <h4>Creators problems list</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>dificult start</li>
                <li>lower open rates</li>
                <li>missing insights</li>
                <li>sending emails to irelevant subscribers</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class='container-narrow  grid gap-20'>
